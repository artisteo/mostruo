# TL:DR

Organizations donate to the projects their members choose

## Organizations



# I am represent a company, why should I use this?

## We dont touch ANY money

You, the company, will make the donations. You will inform us so we can confirm this and your employees know that you are doing this for real

Only you touch the money and have the final deccision to make each donation

# how thoes this work?

- Companie selects the solidary projects employees can donate their budgets
- Employees chosee the solidary project
- At a configurable time all employee selections are consolidated and payment instructions are generated for companies
- The employee is notificated: '"Your Company Name" donated XX â‚¬ to "Organization Name" in your name'

Your employees will read your copy when they enter to choose their donations.

We have some restrictions here, we want you to engage with them for good things, to celebrate some big success, to congratulate a promotion... not for promoting goods or services or conducting random surveys

### Free forever

This is a non profit project with the intention to do a bit of good, we will never ask for money, sell any service or promote or affiliate with anything

We could collaborate with companies to cover only operational costs like databases or servers but we belive we can do a lot of things and help real causes with none or very little operationa lcosts

### Open source

All the code is here, you can run it on your own servers or do whatever you want with it

We would preffer that this is not used for commercial operations but we are no one to tell you what to do

### Made by voluntaries

Collaborators work in this project because they belive this can help and make a real difference

Specialists of every field donate their time to this project, to help companies and employees donate their resources
