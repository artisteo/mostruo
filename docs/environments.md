We have 3 environments: production, , preview, , and development, where developers work in their local machine.

# Production

Where the real users interact with our system

## Production environment variables live in vercel

# Preview

Where we can do almost anything

We CAN NOT touch real data

# Development

## Development envirnoment in vercel is pulled by developers
This environment variables are managed in vercel project's dashboard and injected to frontend and backend

## On local, variables come from .env.local
The .env.local file in apps folder is generated by running `vercel env pull` in the root folder of the project linked to vercel
