# Mostruo CI / CD

All CI / CD operations are handled by [Managed Next.js with Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#managed-nextjs-with-vercel)

## Scalability and operational costs

#### How much can we grow (how much traffic can we take) in the hobby plan?

### Frontend hosting

#### How much can we grow (how much traffic can we take) in the hobby plan?

> TODO we have to update this after we have some traffic to see if is accurate or we missed something

**Limit is 100 GB Bandwidth per month**

Super optimistic scenario:

- 2000 tenants
- 20 users per tenant
  - 40000 monthy users
  - 10 monthly sessions per user
    - 400000 sessions per month

Each user will do 10 sesions each month, and each sessiÃ³n will consume 1MB of bandwith.
In this scenario **we would consume 400000MB of bandwith**, having still **600000MB free** in the hobby plan
**2000 tenants and 40000 users** is a pretty big traffic for a free hosting

### Serverless backend

> **TODO** Add info and simulations about vercel serverless functions free tier limits

### CI / CD

> **TODO** Add info and simulations about vercel ci/cd free tier limits
